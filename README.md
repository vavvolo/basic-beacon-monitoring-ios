# basic-beacon-monitoring-ios

## What's this

This is a template project autogenerated from Estimote Cloud designed to show how to display
a local notifications based on beacon monitoring.

The project has been modified to use CocoaPods.

## How to get up and running

Clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/vavvolo/basic-beacon-monitoring-ios.git
```

Install EstimoteSDK via CocoaPods.

```
cd basic-beacon-monitoring-ios
pod install
```

Open the project with Xcode. Be sure to open the workspace file.

```
open BeaconMonitoringNotifDp4.xcworkspace
```

Add the _AppDelegate.swift_ file set the Estimote App Token 
and UUID, major, and minor number of your test beacon.

```
...
let estimoteAppToken = "PUT THERE THE APP TOKEN"
let testBeaconUUIDString = "PUT HERE THE BEACON UUID AND SET THE CORRECT VALUES FOR MAJOR AND MINOR BELOW"
let testBeaconMajonNumber: CLBeaconMajorValue = 123
let testBeaconMinorNumber: CLBeaconMinorValue = 123

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
ESTConfig.setupAppID("beacon-monitoring-notif-dp4", andAppToken: estimoteAppToken)
...

```

## Tips

- The app does not work correcly on the simulator, you need to use a real device

- Our test beacons have been set to low power mode, be sure to increase the power using the Estimote app before start testing

- Testing geofences can be tricky, you can turn on the _Flip to Sleep_ settings of your beacon to simulate entering/existing a region,
without having to physically move away from the beacon

- There's a 30 sec built in delay for the _on enter_ and _on leave_ events
